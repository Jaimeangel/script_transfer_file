In my current role, I completed mandatory online training about cybersecurity and information protection. The training was focused not only on technical risks, but also on ethical responsibility.

I learned that good conduct means being responsible with the company’s information and acting with care. Even small actions, like opening an email or sharing a document, can have big consequences. The training showed me that each employee must help protect the company, the clients, and the market.

Since then, I take more care in my day-to-day work. I report suspicious emails, follow the company’s rules, and avoid sharing details about my projects or tasks outside the company. I also think more about how my actions can affect others and the organization.

This training helped me understand that good conduct is not only about following rules, but also about doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. It’s about protecting trust and acting with integrity every day.



For me, a good Conduct Culture means working in a place where respect, communication, and clear rules are part of daily life. It’s about doing the right thing and treating people well—clients, colleagues, and partners.

I believe that good conduct includes having clear goals, good communication between teams, and transparency in the way we work. When everyone understands their responsibilities and feels respected, the work environment is much better.

In my experience, when the culture is positive and respectful, employees feel motivated and happy. This directly improves the service we give to clients and the results we achieve. Good conduct helps build trust, both inside the company and with the outside world.

What I admire about Company A is the positive attitude of the people. They are always ready to help, work together, and keep a good spirit. That makes a big difference in teamwork and results. To me, this is a strong example of good conduct in action.

In one of my automation projects, I had already collected all the requirements and started building the solution. As usual, I made a time estimation for the delivery, and every Monday I had a meeting with my manager to update the progress.

However, during this project, an unexpected technical problem appeared. It took me almost two extra weeks to solve it. Even if I had considered some buffer time, there was a risk that I wouldn’t meet the expected timeline.

Fortunately, this was a project where the delivery date could be adjusted if needed. So, instead of waiting, I decided to talk to my manager immediately. I explained the situation and what was causing the delay. Together, we agreed to extend the deadline and adjust the schedule.

From this experience, I learned that when unexpected problems appear, the best way to act is quickly and with transparency. Good communication helps to manage the situation on time and prevents bigger problems. It also builds trust between team members and helps to find the best solution without extra pressure.
